This project was generated with the help of GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant that provides code suggestions and completions based on natural language input.


## Snake

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or with its own body. In this implementation, the player can control the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

## Sudoku

The Sudoku game is a classic puzzle game where the player must fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. In this implementation, the player can click on a cell to select it, and then use the number keys on the keyboard to enter a digit.

## How to Play

To play the games, simply open the `snake.html` file in a modern web browser or `python snake.py`. The Snake game will start automatically when trigger and keyboard button, and the Sudoku game can be accessed by running `python suduko.py` in the top navigation bar.

## Credits

The Snake game is based on the classic arcade game of the same name, and the Sudoku game is based on the popular puzzle game. The code for both games was written by Jianzhu Guo with Github Copilot.
